        <p>Hi there! I’m Cayetano, a passionate mathematician dedicated to helping students discover their potential in math. My love for math began early, as I spent my high school years working on trigonometric proofs and infinite series in between classes, always seeking to understand the deeper beauty behind mathematical concepts. Since then, I've expanded my self-study to cover various branches of mathematics—ranging from Calculus and Real Analysis to Set Theory and Functional Analysis.</p>
        <p>I believe math is a powerful way to sharpen critical thinking, and I aim to make it accessible and enjoyable for students of all levels. Whether you're struggling with the basics or aiming to tackle advanced concepts, my tutoring is tailored to your unique learning style and pace. I make it my mission  to bring a deep understanding of mathematics that goes beyond memorizing formulas.</p>
        <p>What sets me apart is my approach to teaching: I don’t just help you solve problems; I teach you how to think about math from a fresh perspective, allowing you to approach new challenges with confidence. I understand that everyone learns differently, and I pride myself on being patient, supportive, and focused on your success.</p>
        <p>If you, or someone you know, are looking to improve your math skills, I’d love to work with you. Together, we’ll build a solid foundation and explore the fascinating world of mathematics in a way that makes sense to you.</p>
